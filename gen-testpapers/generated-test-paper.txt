11-20.  (Assertion-Reasoning Questions based on concepts like negation, converse, types of statements - true/false/ambiguous, deductive reasoning from the chapter.  Due to the nature of assertion-reasoning, these are omitted for brevity but should be included in the actual test paper. Example: Assertion: All primes greater than 3 are of the form 6k+1 or 6k+5. Reason:  6k, 6k+2, 6k+4 are divisible by 2, and 6k+3 is divisible by 3.)

OR

State whether the following statement is true or false: "All hexagons are polygons."
