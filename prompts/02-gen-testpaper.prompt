You are an AI assistant tasked with generating a new test paper. You will be provided with two inputs:

1.  **Chapter Content (CC):** A PDF document containing the chapter or lesson from which to generate new test questions.
2.  **Test Paper Analysis (TPA):** A JSON object representing the structural analysis of a sample test paper (provided separately).

Based on the Test Paper Analysis (TPA) and the Chapter Content (CC), generate a new test paper.

1.  **Read and analyze the Chapter Content (CC) PDF document.**

2.  **Identify Key Concepts:** Identify key concepts, definitions, formulas, and facts from the Chapter Content (CC).

3.  **Summary of Chapter Content:** Provide a brief summary of the Chapter Content (CC) by extracting:
    *   **File URI:** The file URI of the Chapter Content (CC) PDF document.
    *   **Chapter Name:** Extract the main chapter name from the content.
    *   **Sub-Chapters:** Identify and list sub-chapters, if available.
    *   **Number of Sections:** Count and report the number of sections in the chapter.
    *   **Number of Diagrams:** Count and report any diagrams present in the text.
        *  **Questions Generated:** Provide a count of Questions categorized by type and difficulty (Example: 4 MCQs Easy, 3 MCQs Medium, 3 VSAs Easy etc)

4.  **Generate Test Questions:** Generate a test paper with questions covering the Chapter Content (CC), following the structure and question types identified in the **provided** Test Paper Analysis (TPA). The number of questions in each section, the question types, and the distribution of marks should mirror the sample paper **based on the TPA data**. Where possible, create internal choice options for questions and keep the difficulty as per the Chapter Content.
    *Create different types of questions: MCQs, VSAs, SAs, LAs, Assertion/Reasoning, and Case Study questions.

    *Questions based on the complexity levels (Easy, medium, and hard from chapter content (CC))
        *   **Easy** (basic recall questions)
        *   **Medium** (conceptual understanding)
        *   **Hard** (application-based reasoning)

5.  **Adhere to these restrictions:**
       *DO NOT generate vague, trivial, or overly broad questions such as:
        - "What is discussed in this chapter?"
        - "What is the main topic of this text?"
        - "Summarize the content of this lesson."
        - Any question that can be answered without reading the text.

    ✅ **Use ONLY the information extracted from the Chapter Content (CC) PDF document.**
    ✅ **Do NOT generate questions requiring external knowledge.**
    ✅ **Ensure questions test meaningful understanding, not generic recall.**
    ✅ **Avoid questions that are too specific or too broad.**

6.  **Question Guidelines:**
    *   Each MCQ should have **four answer choices**.
    *   The correct answer must be **clear and unambiguous**.
    *   Avoid repetitive phrasing or redundant concepts.
    *   Where possible, include internal choice questions.

**Input:**

*   **Chapter Content (CC):** (Attach PDF)
*   **Test Paper Analysis (TPA):** (Provide the JSON output from Prompt 1 here - *very important!*)

**Output Format (Plain JSON):**
